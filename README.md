In this project, I didn't successfuly implemented GraphQL because to be honest I am really not familliar and knowledgable about this kind of technology. I also tried to open the link https://countries-274616.ew.r.appspot.com which is provided as reference below the task description which I think I should use as the Graph API / Server of the Flag Datas but, I can't successfully open the link.(Which I think because of some missing dependencies which I do not know). I tried to study and understand how to implement GraphQL using Apollo-Client and creating an GraphQL server using express-graphql dependencies , but unfortunately I didn't managed to have an output and finish the task in the alloted time due to lack of knowledge and experience using this type of technology. I am very much willing to learn about this technology because it really got my interest.

In this output, I decided to stick using REST Api using https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all so I can show some output for the task.

If I had more time or a day, I think I would like to improve for this project is that I will focus more on implementing a search engine and a filter based on regions of the flags since the API I used also includes a data for region on each country. And most importantly, I am really interested to implement the GraphQL in this task because it really caught my interest to explore. I am currently watching some talks that explains the advantages of this kind of implementation. I hope to have a chance sooner or later to explore this type of technology with you. 

Thank you!
